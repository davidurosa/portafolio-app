    "description": "I am a Software Developer, with experience in PHP, specifically with the Laravel Framework. Most of my projects have been worked with this Framework, due to its flexibility, its integrity and its robustness. I also have a lot of experience in database administration with MySQL. In addition, I have worked on the front-end development of Javascript with its different frameworks. As well as I have done web design work. On the other hand, with React Native Framework I have developed mobile applications for Android.",
